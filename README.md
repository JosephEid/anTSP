My final year dissertation project: A teaching tool capable of producing solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem using an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm.

Before building: [Download FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself) and put the folder in the static/styles directory. Add this path to lines 22 and 25 respectively to index.html and about.html by replacing the href with href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/fontawesome-free-5.8.1-web/css/all.css') }}".
Refer to Manual.pdf to see how to build and the tool run locally.
